# Fungi ( Rust )

### Another Game Engine?

This is a port of my Javascript / WebGL 2.0 engine. It's a learning experience to learn Rust and Web Assembly.
Ideally this project will be slow as the Javascript version will be the one I will spent most of my time
developing till I reach a certain point where I will begin to transition to the rust version. My hopes is to build
an engine that will run as a desktop application and through a browser online. 

So for now the main focus of the Rust version is to get some basic 3D stuff running.

### Things to do

- [x] Running as a Web Assembly Module
- [x] State and Render Loop
- [ ] Port Fungi.js Math Library to Rust
- [x] Build Simple ECS Framework
- [ ] Create Extra Storage Types for ECS ( SparseVec, Hashmap )
- [x] Shader Support
- [x] Orbit Camera
- [x] Handle Mouse Input
- [ ] Visual Debugging Features
- [ ] Primatives (Done: Quad, Grid Floor, Need: Cube, Sphere, Verts, Lines )
- [ ] Handle Keyboard Input
- [ ] Uniform Object Buffers
- [ ] Custom Frame Buffers
- [ ] Texture Handling
- [ ] GLTF Support
- [ ] Armature / Skinning / Animation System
- [ ] Inverse Kinematrics
